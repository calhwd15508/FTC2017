FTC2017

This is the code I wrote in senior year for my FTC Robotics Team in the 2016-2017 season.

For more information about the challenge that year, refer to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCQ_pgSw_-8

One of the primary objectives for the autonomous portion of the competition was using a Visual Recognition Program called Vuforia to track the locations of different pictures, then use a color sensor and press the correct button above the picture in order to gain points for the round.
In order to see the code written for this, go to TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode
HardwareRobo1 is the hardware class written to give the code a reference to the hardware
TeleOpRobo1 is the class written for the controller portion of the competition
AutoOpRoboR2 and AutoOpRoboB2 are the autonomous programs written for the red and blue side, respectively
